According to Wikipedia, in software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms i.e. trying to create objects in a manner that is suitable to a given situation. In simple words, we can say that the Creational Design Pattern deals with Object Creation and Initialization. This Design Pattern gives the programmer more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given situation.

The Creational design patterns are categorized into two types. They are as follows:

Object-creational patterns: Object-creational patterns deal with object creation. Here, it defers part of its object creation to another object.
Class-creational patterns: The Class-creational patterns deal with class-instantiation. Here, it defers its object creation to subclasses
